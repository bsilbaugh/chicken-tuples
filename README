An implementation of (static) n-tuples in Chicken Scheme

Description
===========

Tuples implements sequences of n elements (p1, ..., pn) as data structures
of fixed size, and provides analogs of the Scheme list operations map and
for-each. 

The expectation is that, for problems of fixed dimension, the n-tuples
provided by Tuples will provide better space and time performance than
Scheme vectors or lists; e.g. the implementation of vector algebra on
3-dimensional spaces. Preliminary benchmarks confirm this expectation.

Status
======

Tuples is usable at this point. However, breaking changes may occur without
notice, and there may still be critical bugs.

Installation
============

Tuples is packaged as a Chicken Scheme Egg. Installation should simply be a
matter of downloading a snapshot of the source tree, and then running
chicken-install.
